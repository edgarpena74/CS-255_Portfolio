### Reflection  

This project focused on building a system for DriverPass, a company that wanted a way for students to prepare for their driving tests. The system was designed to provide:  
- Online classes and practice exams  
- Scheduling for in-person driving lessons  
- Tools for staff to manage appointments, track records, and keep information secure  

**Strengths:**  
The strongest part of my work was identifying the different users of the system and making sure their needs were clear in both the business requirements and the system design. That foundation made the design process more organized.  

**Improvements:**  
If I went back to make changes, I would refine the system diagrams. While they showed the main ideas well, some parts could be laid out more clearly to better explain how information moves through the system.  

**User Needs:**  
A big part of this project was translating user needs into actual features. I did this by going through the interview transcript and making sure every request was connected to a part of the design. Keeping the user in mind is important, because even the best technical solution won’t matter if it doesn’t solve the client’s problems.  

**Design Approach:**  
For software design, my approach is to break down requirements into smaller, clear pieces, then model how those pieces fit together. Moving forward, I’d continue using both process and object modeling since they give a complete picture of how a system should function.
